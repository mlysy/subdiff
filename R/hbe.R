#' @format A dataset containing 76 simulated 2D particle trajectories sampled at 60 Hz.  The four columns of the data are:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{`id`}{Particle ID (1-76).}
#'   \item{`t`}{Time at which position was recorded (in seconds).}
#'   \item{`x`}{Particle position on `x`-axis at time `t` (in microns).}
#'   \item{`y`}{Particle position on `y`-axis at time `t` (in microns).}
#' }
