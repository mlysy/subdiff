Description: Tools for implementing various models for particle subdiffusion in biological fluids.  In addition to the well-known semiparametric least-squares estimator based on the mean square displacement (MSD), the package provides functions for simulation, inference, and goodness-of-fit for two fully-parametric subdiffusion models: fractional Brownian motion and the generalized Langevin equation (GLE) model with Rouse memory kernel.  A generic model class allows users to easily implement custom subdiffusion models, with a ready-made framework for drift, high-frequency error correction, and efficient maximum likelihood estimation.
