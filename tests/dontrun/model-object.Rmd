## Test case: fBM model

For simplicity just do this as a basic `S3` object.  So the model is a list with elements:

- `theta_names`: A character vector of parameter names, excluding the generic LS parameters `mu` (or `beta`?) and `Sigma`.
- `acf`: A function with arguments at least including `N` and `dT`, and those in `theta_names`.  Other non-optimized parameters can also be specified, e.g., "number of components".
- `theta_trans` and `theta_itrans`: transformation back and forth from parameter list.  The first takes named arguments in `theta_names`, the second takes a single vector `theta` and returns a list.  This takes care of parameter restrictions, since on the transformed scale everything is unrestricted.  This only needs to be done for parameters, not nuisance parameters.
- `penalty`: An optional penalty function for the likelihood with named arguments `theta_names`.  

This is a good start for now.  So for example:

```{r, fbm_ex, eval = FALSE}
fbm_theta <- "alpha"
fbm_acf <- function(alpha, N, dT) {...}
fbm_trans <- function(alpha) logit(alpha, min = 0, max = 2)
fbm_itrans <- function(theta) list(alpha = ilogit(theta, min = 0, max = 2))

fbm_model <- list(theta_names = fbm_theta,
                  acf = fbm_acf,
                  theta_trans = fbm_trans,
                  theta_itrans = fbm_itrans)
class(fbm_model) <- "csi_model"
```

For now, let's try re-implementing the existing functions as follows:

```{r, fbm_fit, eval = FALSE}
fbm_fit <- function(dX, dT, Tz, var_calc = TRUE) {
  # problem dimensions
  N <- nrow(dX)
  qq <- ncol(dX)
  nq <- .get_nq(qq) # rewrite this function in anticipation of qq > 2
  csi_fit(model = fbm_model,
          dX = dX, dT = dT, Tz = Tz, # data arguments
          penalty = FALSE, # don't penalize (error if penalize when no penalty defined)
          var_calc = var_calc)
}
```

`fbm_model` will eventually be placed in package, but for now it can just be a loose object.

## Next steps

- Add `fma_model` and `farma_model`.  The former is interesting because it contains parameters `p` and `q` which should not be optimized.  In other words, we might have

```{r, csi_fit, eval = FALSE}
#' @param ... Additional arguments passed to \code{model$acf}.
#' @param penalty Either a logical, in which case \code{penalty = TRUE} uses the default penalty function, or a function with arguments in \code{model$theta_names}.
csi_fit <- function(model, dX, dT, Tz, var_calc, penalty, ...)
```
