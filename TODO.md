# TODO List

1. [ ] Standardize unconstrained parametrization for variances.

2. [x] Fix `.get_nq` for values of `q > 2`.

3. [ ] Create methods for S3 model objects.

4. [ ] Check over documentation, including function and argument names.  In particular, `order` argument to `farma` models is inconsistent...

5. [ ] Remove `old` from repo (version controlled anyways).

6. [ ] Fix `*_resid` functions.  Currently using depreciated `trans_alpha`, etc.

7. [ ] `msd_fit` and `msd_subdiff` should compare true MSD to estimate.  Also, should use GLE model.
