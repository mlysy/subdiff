## `model` object

The models are increments of CSI location-scale models,
$$
\XX(t) = (X_1(t), \ldots, X_q(t)) = \mmu \, \FF(t \mid \pph)  + \SSi^{1/2} \ZZ(t),
$$
where $FF(t \mid \pph) \in \R^d$ are functions known up to $\pph$, $\mmu_{q\times d}$ is a matrix of "regression coefficients", and $\ZZ(t) \in \R^q$ are iid CSI processes with MSD $\eta(t \mid \pph)$.  Very often, the drift is just linear, i.e., $d = 1$ and $f_1(t) = t$.

- [x] acf as function of $\pph$.
- [ ] drift as function of $\pph$.  For the special case $f_1(t) = t$ just leave this empty and model object will know what to do.

	Question: how do we tell model that drift is not constant but doesn't depend on $\pph$?
- [x] parameter names of elements of $\pph$.

	Question: how do we handle general ARMA$(p,q)$ models?
- [x] parameter transformations.  Optional set of functions to transform $\pph$ to a better computational basis (`trans()`) and back (`itrans()`).  For example, using $\nu = \logit(\alpha/2)$ is unconstrained, so the fitting is much better on this scale.

- [ ] gradient of acf wrt $\pph$ (optional)
- [x] penalty (optional)


## generic methods

- `summary(model)`: point est (regular scale) standard error (regular scale) CI (asymmetric)
- `coef`: overload estimates
- `sigma`: standard errors
- `confint`: confidence intervals (flags: regular/comp, sym/asym)
- `simulate`: simulate a bunch of paths
- `residuals`: get white noise from process
- `vcov`: computational or human basis? ans: both, so that we can convert back and forth

## `fitted_model` object

- mle
- variance matrix
- conversion functions for all parameters (incl. error)
- data


## fit method (external)

- interface: something like `csi_fit(model = fbm, data = x, ...)`
- optimization routine:

    - `optimize` (1-d)
    - `optim` (multi d)
    - `nlm` (multi d)

    which of optim/nlm to use by default? maybe depends on gradient?
	
- detrend t/f, 
- hf error removal t/f (use MA(1) model from aoas)
- `control` argument: passes other control arguments to desired fitting method

## other things for package

- documentation: examples, vignette(s) i.e., tutorials, github page
- q > 2 dimensions.  computational basis for q > 3?

##  TODO

- create subrepo with other packages `SuperGauss` and `LMN`.
- create an fbm S3 "object", i.e., a list with elements above.
- create each of the generics.
- create an informal tutorial/vignette for math + code of what we're doing with fbm.
